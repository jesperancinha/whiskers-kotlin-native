## Chapter II - The Cat That Helped Lucy

## Recap

After being diagnosed with a debilitating unknown disease affecting her nervous system, Lucy decided to leave The Netherlands and live a reclusive life in Portugal.
In Portugal, Lucy found refuge and a safe place in Armona, an Island on the other side of a river flowing along the Olhão Marina, South of Portugal. There, Lucy began to have visions and confronting her past.

## The cat that helped Lucy

Back in The Netherlands, Lucy had, among many of her jobs, one for a Telecom company called `Infrastructure Collective Zaphire BV`. It was also known as INCO. At INCO, Lucy was responsible to develop software to support a variety of Telecom services.
This was the job she got after her position at `BeRGees`. In Lucy's dream, she remembered Hara Arre. Hara was someone with her eyes on power, fame and reputation. She cared very little about her own position or the company itself. Needless to say that Hara would make the best to exploit the work from Lucy even claiming at times Lucy's work as her own work. The dream shifted back to INCO to a meeting with another one of her former bosses: Fenestev Moon.
Lucy and Mr. Moon went to a meeting to clarify some concerns brought up by Lucy. Lucy was always concerned about the safety of the company and due to her knowledge she was aware that some drastic changes had to be made in regard to the software being produced. The dream turns to something Lucy remembers being the inflexion point in her decision to remain or not in the company.
Fenestev, like Hara Arre, only had his sight on power and immediate profit and so concerns were seen to him as `unwanted weak negative emotions`. Lucy remembered his trick:

- Fenestev Moon: I appreciate the fact that you bring this up to me. But you also have to understand the business side of our company. I can't spend money like that to invest in new sofware that way. And then you know you say this and then it happens and then the computer gets broken and the car I have to take and the weather gets bad and when I cook the computer gets down... you don't follow me do you Lucy?
- Lucy: With all due respect Mr. Moon, I'm not sure if I understand you.
- Fenestev Moon: That's what I mean, you don't have what it takes to understand business. Please go back to your post.

For Lucy, it became clear that she would never go anywhere in the company since this was her CEO and so little was expected of her. Her job was at stake and the odds were going against her.
Lucy wakes up startled in the middle of the night. She was back in `Armona`. Her place was quiet and it felt safe.
